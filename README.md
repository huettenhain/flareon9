# Deobfuscator for FlareOn9, Challenge 8

This is my code for deobfuscating challenge 8 of FlareOn9.
I am not, by any means, an expert in .NET (de)obfuscation, so for the time being I will not advertise this as a representative example of how this should be done.
However, I wanted to have the solution online and public so I can more easily show people what I did and discuss the approach.
The project requires the [AsmResolver][] library, and I am deeply indebted to the author for being extremely helpful with questions.
